==============

Code, markup, style-sheets, images and other assets for www.blocked.org.uk

HTML/CSS is based on Bootstrap 3

These pages contain the HTML for the pages before it's put into modX, so best to be sure that you're working from latest code from modX as this may be out of date - it's mainly to get the initial design/coding in place before final tweaks & wording sorted in modX.

Several internal links are currently just marked with *****stars like this***** as they'll need to have internal references added when put into modx
