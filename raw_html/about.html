                    <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
                    <p>Filtering technologies are being promoted by government as a means to prevent children from accessing inappropriate sexual material. However in practice, many more people are finding themselves behind filters, which block a much wider range of material. Sometimes, like blogs or forums, this may be deliberate but not really necessary, while at other times, it can be by mistake.</p>
                    <p>This makes filters unnecessarily disruptive to the [[Open Internet]] and very difficult for website owners to understand what is happening, and correct or limit damage.</p>
                    <h3>Other censorship</h3>
                    <p>Other censorship is mandatory but not well documented, starting with copyright blocks. Here, court orders allow the claimant to order ISPs to block any domain or sometimes IP address that is serving copies of the original. Orders are usually drafted to be indefinite and blocking pages do not explain the legal basis not how to complain or correct mistakes. </p>
                    <p>This will have some impact on the reports we receive of blocks on networks.</p>

                        <h3>Contact your MP</h3>
                        <p>If MPs don't hear the concerns of their constituents they won't fight for the changes they want to see. So please write to your local MP to share your concerns about censorship, or better yet, meet them and discuss in person. You can find out who your MP is and how to contact them on <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">theyworkforyou.com</a>.</p>

                            <li>offering mechanisms to discover and report problems</li>

                    <h2>Making it so</h2>
                    <h3>Discovering and reporting filtering problems</h3>
                    <p>You can submit sites or pages for testing via the *****blocked.org.uk homepage*****. We then check whether the URL is blocked by the default filters of all the major UK home broadband providers. The tests are automatic. Results are returned within a few seconds and emailed to you (if you tell us your address). We also display the results of any previous tests for this URL.</p>
                    <p>In terms of reporting and correcting filtering issues, home broadband ISPs currently lag behind mobile operators, however both types of company still lack transpareny in this area and their processes can be a pain to navigate. We have collected as much information as we can find about *****getting a site unblocked***** (unblock.html) however we think the industry could do more. </p>
                    <h3>Collect evidence and maintain an open record of censorship</h3>
                    <p>We have deployed a number of probes on both mobile and fixed-line ISPs. These probes test whether a particular URL is blocked on the networks to which they are connected. There are <a title="Wiki page with diagrams showing how we check URLs for censorship" href="https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Censorship_Monitoring_Project_Functional_Spec">overview and use case diagrams</a> on our wiki that explain the process in more detail.</p>
                    <p>At the moment all the probes we've deployed are controleld by ORG. In future we want to extend our reach by including results from probes run by people like you.</p>
                    <p>We are building an Android client that will allow people to help us test blocking on networks we can't reach - for example public wifi hotspots or niche mobile operators.</p>
                    <p>We also have scripts to build a stand-alone probe on a Raspberry Pi so that you can run your very own censorship monitor at home. Browser plugins and desktop applications are possibilities too.</p>
                    <p>See the *****Get Involved***** page for more details about these exciting developments.
