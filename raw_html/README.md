# Blocked HTML

This is the raw HTML to be put into modx...


## To do big jobs

* Get FormSave working on main form on home page - not sure what's going on there - my best (and possibly not great) idea is that the db it's using isn't created or permissions for it set up, or I've missed something obvious (entirely likely!)
* Integrate with API - probably syncing the modX FormSave table with the API one on the server (will be different for staging/live)
* Get results back to website, perhaps using PHP to collect the results via the API and spit them out as JSON, and could use JS to display the results in a table


## Needed

* project name -  is this decided now?
* page content - I've copied most of it from the existing blocked site or the wiki, I've made up the odd title/paragraph here and there
* get better copies of org logo - could someone email me a vector/hi res image please
* text for ORG header and footer (or which pages to link to)
* list of fairly generic categories of site - I've got Business/educational/Charity/personal/govt at the moment - any more needed?
* Some personal stories (or could hide this page until we have some)
* Unblock page will need info for broadband providers in addition to mobile.


## Finishing touches - I can do these when back unless anything is urgent

* favicons
* fallbacks for font sizes in rems
* add links in via modx (currently highlight *****like this***** in text)
* add footer links in using modx when on main server
* submission of form goes to results page, which should show the results for the submitted URL if they exist.
* Style form submission success message better
* Donate page - tidy up PayPal buttons, etc
* Donate page - add a larger call to action for direct debit sign up, and possibly add in ORG logo at top.
* possibly use a couple more pictures on site - eg rasp pi on project page - but only where it adds to content
* check h1/2/3 levels all correct
* format getting involved page better
* getting involved page to have prominent 'contact MP' box - or ideally form to email them directly
* add jump nav for ISPs in unblock page
* stories page - experiment with drop quotes for more awesome
* highlight current page in navigation
* Add quick contact forms in a couple of places (personal stories/unblock) to make it easier for people to make contact



## Stuff for the future

* How to unblock your site pages
* Contact form for ORG if people have trouble unblocking
* Contact MP/take action stuff <- is there a page on ORG (or another site) where you enter your postcode and it gets your MP and a form to contact them like I've seen on some sites (38 degrees??) I think this would be good to make it easy to do. I've added in placeholder text for this on a couple of pages.
* JS sexiness for form
